## 🍟 What is VibeSplit?

Imagine you and your friends go to the canteen. You eat, drink, and have fun. But when it’s time to pay, everyone forgets who paid for what! VibeSplit is your magical helper that makes splitting group expenses super easy. No more math headaches or lost track of money!

## ☕️ The Story (Like a 3rd Grader!)

Once upon a time, at TSEC canteen, a group of friends (that’s us!) wanted to enjoy snacks without fighting over bills. We wished for a friendly web app that could:
- Remember who paid
- Split costs fairly
- Make everyone smile at the end!

So, we built VibeSplit. Now, anyone can use it to keep the fun and lose the confusion!
